                    <h3>Finetuning BERT to Detect Insincere Quora Submissions (Python)</h3>
                    <p>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was developed by Google AI as a "swiss-army knife" to answer many of natural language processing (NLP) problems, including sentiment analysis, question answering, text generation, summarization, and text prediction. Training a natural language learning model such as BERT is very expensive and time-consuming because of the large number of parameters (110M+) and the massive amount of traning data (3.3 billion words). Therefore, we utilize transfer learning with Tensorflow and Tensorflow Hub in order to finetune a pre-trained BERT model onto our dataset, which is a selection of sincere and insincere questions from Quora.com, in order to classify whether or not a question is authentic.</p>

                    <h3>Finetuning a Semantic Segmentation model on AWS SageMaker to Identify Boundaries in Pet Images (Python)</h3>
                    <p>Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision algorithm that uses deep learning to classify each pixel within an image as foreground, background, or boundary. It uses a fully convolutional network (FCN), unlike traditional convolutional networks (CNNs) that contain fully connected layers. This enables FCNs to excel in pixel-wise classification, which is used in medical imaging to detect tumors and other anatomical structures, in satellite image analysis to monitor urban developments, or in social media applications to determine the depth and overlay certain filters.</p>
                    <p>In this project, I use AWS Sagemaker to finetune and deploy a semantic segmentation model to outline the borders of pets within different images</p>

Window functions allow for row-level granularity and access to rows above and below the current row. Some window functions include: ROW_NUMBER(), LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE(), RANK(), NTILE()</p>

                    <h3>Using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to Generate Synthetic Data to Resolve Class Imbalance (Python)</h3>
                    <p>In certain datasets, like credit card fraud detection, one class (e.g., non-fraudulent transactions) often greatly outnumbers the other (fraudulent transactions), leading to class imbalance. This imbalance can introduce biases when training machine learning models, as the model may become overly biased toward predicting the majority class.</p>
                    <p>In this project, I first applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which originally contained 29 features, down to 2 components. This dimensionality reduction helps to visualize the structure of the data, revealing how fraudulent transactions compare to genuine ones in a lower-dimensional space.
Next, I implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions. The GAN consists of two components: a Generator that creates new, synthetic fraudulent data, and a Discriminator that evaluates the authenticity of the generated data against real fraudulent transactions. By training these two components in opposition, the GAN is able to generate increasingly realistic fraudulent transactions.
Finally, I visualized the comparison between the real and synthetic fraudulent transactions across the 28 features. This allowed me to analyze how each feature behaves in both the genuine and synthetic fraud samples, providing insights into the characteristics of fraudulent transactions and how well the GAN can replicate those characteristics.</p>

                    <h3>Using AWS Autogluon to predict rent prices in Canada based on city, province, latitude, longitude, lease term, type, price, beds, baths, square feet, furnishing, availability date, smoking allowed, and whether cats and dogs are allowed</h3> 
                    <p>AWS AutoGluon is an open-source machine learning library developed by AWS that automates the process of building, training, and deploying high-performance models, with a focus on ease of use and efficiency, including tabular, image, and text data. In this project, I used its Tabular predictor to perform regression on Canadian rent prices based on a selection of features.</p>
                    <p>First part (data exploration, model training, and model evaluation): data cleaning and model training with Autogluon, and then evaluating the model based on MAE.</p>
                    <p>Second part (feature importance and explainable AI): longitude and latitude were the most important when it comes to determining price, followed by baths, beds, and type. Surprisingly, whether cats and dogs were allowed, and whether smoking is allowed, were the least important. I also plotted residuals to see how the model predictions performed against actual prices.</p>

                    <h3>Classifying Diabetes with PySparkML (PySpark)</h3>
                    <p>There are two types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes (which is when the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the body) develops early in life, and Type 2 diabetes (which is when the body develops insulin resistance) usually develops gradually over time due to lifestyle-related factors. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed through diet, weight loss, or exercise, and therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease is crucial.</p>
                    <p>Type 2 diabetes can have numerous indicating factors including pregnancy, blood glucose level, skin thickness, insulin resistance, BMI, age, and many more. However, because oftentimes these symptoms develop slowly, they may be difficult to recognize. Therefore, we utilize PySpark ML in order to train a model to classify whether or not a patient has diabetes, with a resulting Area Under the Curve of 0.8412.</p>

                    <h3>Predicting Customer Churn (PySpark)</h3>
                    <p>Customer churn is one of the most important metrics of any business, because the cost of acquiring a new client far exceeds the cost of retaining an existing client. In this project, we used a variety of classification algorithms from PySpark including decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, naive bayes, and other classification algorithms in order to predict whether a customer will churn (exit) based on their features such as credit score, geography, membership, tenure, and many more.</p>
                    <p>After training all of the models, the gradient boosting model was selected because it had the highest F1 score and area under PR; metrics were selected because of the unbalanced nature of customers who exit and those who stayed. A gradient boosting model for the purpose of cross-validation was then created for hyperparameter tuning. The final model had an F1 score of 0.8371 and an accuracy of 0.8485.</p>

                    <p>Employees may become less productive the longer they stay at the same company, due to many underlying factors. This project builds a neural network model to predict employee attrition and then see if concessions given would reduce or eliminate attrition. Ultimately, this can be used to see if an employee should be given extra concessions or replaced.</p>
